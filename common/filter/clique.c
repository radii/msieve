	/* Perform the clique removal phase of NFS filtering. This
	   operation does some really cool stuff, and it is not
	   described very thoroughly in references, so I'll do that
	   here.

	   Suppose that at the end of NFS sieving you have X relations.
	   Each relation has zero or more large ideals, and there is
	   a total of Y unique large ideals in the whole dataset.
	   Then this collection of relations can form X-Y cycles, 
	   allowing you to build a matrix for an NFS factor base 
	   of size X-Y. Suppose that the factor base size is Z but
	   X-Y is much larger than that. This means you can get rid
	   of relations until X-Y has been reduced to Z. The opti-
	   mization problem is then: which relations must you throw
	   away so that when X-Y = Z the resulting matrix is as sparse
	   as possible?

	   When you delete a relation, X is decremented; when that
	   relation contained the last instance of some ideal, Y is
	   decremented. If X and Y are both decremented by about the 
	   same amount, X-Y is about the same as before and you can
	   keep removing relations. We assume that when X-Y = Z, the
	   matrix will be more sparse when X is smaller. So the 
	   optimization problem now becomes: which relations must you
	   delete so that the largest number of ideals are also 
	   removed from the dataset? This is a much more specific
	   version of the original optimization problem.

	   Suppose that a particular large ideal occurs in exactly
	   two relations. Then if one of those relations is deleted
	   the other relation becomes a singleton, and will have to be
	   deleted as well. More generally suppose you have a collection
	   of relations, and the collection contains a bunch of ideals
	   that only occur in pairs of those relations. If each relation
	   in the group has at least one of those ideals that only occur 
	   in pairs, then deleting one of the relations means the 
	   whole group can be deleted as well. In graph theory terms, 
	   our collection of relations is a connected subgraph of 
	   the complete dataset. If it was *fully* connected, i.e. every
	   relation had an ideal in common with all other relations in the
	   component, it would have a shorter name: a clique. Even though
	   it is a misnomer to call the component a clique in all cases,
	   with NFS filtering it is traditional to do so. We therefore
	   call the process of finding and deleting connected components
	   a 'clique removal' phase.

	   In this specific case we only want cliques that contain ideals 
	   of 'weight 2', and that problem can be solved efficiently. We 
	   just need a hashtable for the ideals of weight 2, combined with 
	   a breadth-first traversal of the complete dataset. All the 
	   relations that form a clique are in a sense tied to each other,
	   so if relations have to be deleted then it makes sense to 
	   concentrate on deleting the 'heaviest' cliques.

	   A clique is 'heavy' if 1) it has many relations, and 2)
	   those relations contain many ideals that have low weight.
	   These conditions together mean that deleting the entire 
	   clique means reducing both X and Y by nearly the same 
	   (large) amount. 

	   A recent development on the scoring of cliques is due to
	   Cyril Bouvier (http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00734654): if an ideal
	   occurs n times in the dataset and m times in a clique, then
	   the weight of the clique is the sum of m/n for each of the
	   ideals of weight > 2. This actually produces slightly
	   worse results at the end of the clique removal compared to
	   Cavallar's weight function, but produces slightly smaller
	   matrices (2-3% smaller) at the end of the merge phase.
	   
	   The clique processing here locates all of the cliques in a 
	   list of NFS relations, saves a bunch of the heaviest ones, 
	   sorts those so the heaviest cliques are first, and then 
	   deletes cliques until either the value of X-Y is sufficiently 
	   reduced or the entire bunch is gone. The point at which clique 
	   deletion stops is only approximate; removing a clique can create 
	   singletons or other cliques elsewhere in the graph. So we can't 
	   delete too many cliques at once, because we could use up our 
	   budget for reducing X but may end up ignoring heavy cliques 
	   that are created later. However, building the list of cliques 
	   takes time, and we don't want to spend too much time squeezing 
	   out every last heavy clique. The size of the list of cliques 
	   to generate determines how aggressive the clique removal is: 
	   the smaller the size, the more aggressive the removal. Calling
	   code is expected to perform clique removal multiple times in
	   a row, and removing only a few cliques at a time means the number
	   of iterations needed to reduce X must increase.

	   Clique removal is cool because it's equivalent to doing a
	   little Gauss elimination on the complete dataset and deleting
	   the heaviest eliminated super-relations. Only this Gauss
	   elimination is very fast and memory efficient. Clique removal
	   is also cool because it greatly rewards having more relations
	   than you strictly need. The more you're willing to prune, 
	   the better the final matrix will turn out to be. 
	   
	   The above explanation applies to cliques containing ideals
	   that appear in exactly two relations. When there is a really
	   huge amount of initial excess, it is possible for the cliques
	   to run out before the excess does :) To deal with this situation,
	   this code is generalized to find cliques with ideals
	   of weight > 2. This is not ordinarily a good idea, but when 
	   there are no weight-2 ideals and there is still excess to burn,
	   it is the best algorithm available for continuing to prune
	   relations */
