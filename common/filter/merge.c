	/* The core of the NFS merge phase; this routine starts
	   with a collection of relation sets, each containing entries
	   drawn from a pool of large ideals, and produces another
	   collection of relation sets that can function as an
	   NFS matrix. More formally, given R relation sets containing
	   I large ideals, we can find at least R-I cycles, and probably
	   much more than that. The exact number will be near R-I+C, where
	   C is the number of connected components in the graph formed
	   by R; we don't know what C is, but it should be a small fraction
	   of R-I.

	   min_cycles is the minimum number of cycles that we absolutely
	   must have in order to make a usable matrix. It is the combined
	   number of ideals in the NFS rational and algebraic factor
	   bases that were never tracked in the rest of the filtering phase,
	   along with a little extra to allow discarding very heavy cycles.
	   Producing a matrix with exactly min_cycles cycles means we will
	   have to merge many ideals from I, which leads to a very dense
	   matrix. On the other hand, R-I can be much larger than min_cycles,
	   and we can instead attempt to produce a number of cycles close
	   to R-I. This reduces the number of merges we would have to do,
	   and leaves us with a very large but very light matrix. Between
	   these two extremes there is a range of 'compromise' matrices.
	   A compromise matrix will ignore some number S of the large ideals
	   in I, and consist of a moderate number (min_cycles+S) of cycles
	   that are moderately dense. The choice of S and resulting cycles
	   depends on how many excess relation sets we have to work with, 
	   and how dense we can tolerate the final matrix.

	   Unlike other filtering implementations, this code attempts to
	   adaptively and automatically determine a good matrix derived from
	   the considerations above, with no user tuning or user parameter
	   choices at all. The critical advantage is that we know at the
	   outset that the complete collection of relation sets will be
	   made to fit in memory, and this allows a global view of the
	   effects of merging choices as the merging runs. It also allows
	   choosing the next ideal to merge in a way that globally minimizes
	   the amount of fill-in added to the current collection of cycles.
	   It thus makes completely unnecessary the complex system of 
	   merge levels, shrinkage passes and relation set cutoff sizes that
	   is typical of filtering implementations derived from Cavallar's
	   paper.

	   We divide I into two sets, the set of active ideals (which we
	   will try to eliminate via merging) and inactive ideals (which
	   we do not try to merge but otherwise process identically). Each
	   large ideal is placed in one of two discrete priority heaps, the
	   active or inactive heap, and each heap is keyed to (an upper 
	   bound on) the amount of fill-in that merging that ideal would 
	   incur. We start with min_cycles ideals in the active heap, and 
	   keep merging ideals until the active heap is empty. A relation 
	   set is considered to be a cycle if it has no active large ideals. 
	   Ideals can move freely between the active and inactive heap,
	   dynamically changing the number of cycles that exist at any given 
	   time. In particular, the active heap will always contain the
	   ideals that will lead to the lightest merges. 

	   When the active heap is empty, if the current number of cycles
	   is at least (min_cycles+(ideals in the inactive heap)), merging
	   can finish. Otherwise, we transfer some ideals from the inactive
	   heap to the active heap, shrinking the number of cycles needed
	   but possibly spoiling previously created cycles, which then have
	   to be merged again. Ideals are also made active if the number
	   of cycles is sufficient but the average cycle weight is too low,
	   since in that case the matrix has room to grow more dense in
	   return for becoming smaller. Finally, whenever the active heap
	   is empty we also 'bury' some of the heaviest ideals in the inactive
	   heap; buried ideals are removed from the ideal lists of all the
	   relation sets containing those ideals, and become ineligible 
	   for merging (since they are not explicitly tracked anymore). 
	   The burying operation leads to a slightly denser matrix, but
	   saves significant amounts of memory as merging progresses.
	   Merging stops when all of these processes converge to a moderate 
	   size matrix with specified density and a sufficient number of 
	   cycles.
	   
	   The effect of this method is that when there are many excess
	   relations, the merge phase produces a usable but too-large matrix
	   as quickly as possible, then gradually reduces its size until
	   the number of nonzero matrix elements exceeds a threshold
	   (or no more merges are possible). */
