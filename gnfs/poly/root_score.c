	/* roots of (poly mod p) can be either ordinary or special.
	   An ordinary root mod p corresponds to exactly one root
	   mod p^k for all k > 1. Murphy shows that for each ordinary 
	   root of (poly mod p) the contribution to the size of a
	   random sieve value due to all powers of p is log(p) * 
	   p/(p^2-1). 
	   
	   We compare this to the contribution of powers of p to 
	   the size of a random number. 1 in p random numbers are 
	   divisible by p, 1 in p^2 random numbers are divisible by
	   p^2, etc. Adding up all of these contributions and summing
	   the resulting geometric series yields an average contribution
	   of log(p) / (p-1). 
	   
	   Hence the root score for poly is the sum of the difference 
	   between the contribution of powers of p in sieve values 
	   compared to the contribution to a random number. When there 
	   are k ordinary roots mod p, root_score is the sum of 

	               log(p) * (1/(p-1) - k*p/(p^2-1))

	   for the first few p, meaning that dividing the small primes 
	   out of sieve values makes their size exp(root_score) times 
	   smaller than dividing the small primes out of a random number.

	   When the number of roots mod p^k changes with k, Murphy's 
	   formula for the contribution is inaccurate (usually it's too
	   small), so we have to take special measures to compute the 
	   contribution of the roots accurately. Roots become special 
	   if p divides the discriminant of poly, and basically the only 
	   effective way to compute the size of the contribution from 
	   special roots is to find the number of roots mod p^k for the
	   first few k and then explicitly sum the first few terms in 
	   the (formerly geometric) series. Many thanks to Kleinjung 
	   and Franke whose pol5 code handles special roots efficiently */
