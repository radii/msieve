/* Rational leading coeffs of NFS polynomials are assumed 
   to be the product of 2 or 3 coprime groups of factors p; 
   each p is < 2^32 and the product of (powers of) one or more
   distinct primes. The arithmetic progressions mentioned 
   above are of the form r_i + k * p^2 for 'root' r_i. 
   p may be prime or composite.
   
   We get a collision when we can find two progressions 
   aprog1(k) = r_i1 + k*p1^2 and aprog2(k) = r_i2+k*p2^2, 
   and integers k1 and k2, such that

   	- p1 and p2 are coprime
	- aprog1(k1) = aprog2(k2)
	- the common value is "close to" m0
   
   If p has several prime factors p_i, the exact number of 
   roots that a given p has is the product of the number of 
   d_th roots of N modulo each p_i. For degree 4 polyomials, N 
   has either 0, 2, or 4 fourth roots mod p_i. For degree 5, 
   N has either 1 or 5 fifth roots mod p_i. For degree 6, 
   N has either 0, 2 or 6 sixth roots mod p_i. So especially
   when p is large and p_i are small, a composite p can 
   contribute a large number of progressions to the collision 
   search

   We will need to generate many p along with all their r_i
   fairly often, and need efficient methods to do so */
